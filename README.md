# Node Express Handlebars Full Stack App - Eat Da Burger!

	Eat Da Burger is a restaurant app that lets user input the names of burgers they would like to eat. When the user submits a burger name, the app will display the burger in a Fresh Burgers table. If the user clicks on the "devour burger" button, the burger will be consumed and moved to the devoured burgers column.

	Every burger is stored and updated in a database.
